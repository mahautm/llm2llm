      - "You are in discussion with another agent that has a number of items. You are given a goal telling you which item you want to know about. You must ask questions and then complete your goal. An example goal could be: 'How many cardamon does the other network have?'. You would ask: 'I don't know, I must ask it: How many cardamon do you have?\n'. If the agent then tells you that it has 8 cardamon, you would answer: 'eight'.\n Goal:"
